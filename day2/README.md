# AMS25 / Day 2 / Hands-on Session

Welcome to the second day of the hands-on sessions at **AMS25**!

## Introduction

Last week you learned general concepts useful for all kinds of atomistic simulations.
Today, we'll be specifically performing **density functional theory (DFT)** calculations.

Compared to last week's simulations that employed classical force fields,
DFT calculations are quantum mechanical.
As a consequence, they are more **acurate**, **informative** and **expensive**.

We'll be performing all calculations using [**Quantum ESPRESSO (QE)**](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/). QE is [free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) and [open-source](https://gitlab.com/QEF/q-e) software.
